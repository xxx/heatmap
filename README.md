heatmap
=======

Some javascript/canvas/web worker heatmap experimentation.

Play along online at [http://heatmapthing.herokuapp.com](http://heatmapthing.herokuapp.com).

You'll need to use a browser that supports canvas and web workers. Right now that means Firefox, Safari, Chrome, or Opera.

Installation
============

1. `bundle install`
1. `bundle exec rackup` or just open `heatmap.html` in a browser directly.

If you're using Google Chrome (or Chromium) and want to open heatmap.html directly, you'll need to start Chrome from the command line and pass `--allow-file-access-from-files` as an argument, or the worker will fail to spawn.

Use
===

Giant hacks alert. This is just a demo.

Mouseover and click the image, then render to see the heat. Smoothing is very slow in some browsers. Heat data can be imported and exported via the textarea. Heat is collected by default on page load.
